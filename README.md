## Find the Closing Parenthesis

You know when you're coding and you've got a lot of nested parentheses (like (this, so (nested)))? And in Sublime Text, when you put your cursor on an opening parenthesis, it knows where its closing one is?

Let's build a method that does that. Write a method that takes two arguments, a sentence (a string), along with the position of an opening parenthesis (its index), and returns the corresponding closing parenthesis.

This assignment is open ended. It's up to you how to build out your method. Psuedo code first, and make it work first before any refactoring. 

Make the tests pass.
